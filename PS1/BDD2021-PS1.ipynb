    "The goal of this problem set is to replicate and extend the core results of  Jean et al.'s 2016 paper, \"Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty.\" This problem set will be challenging and time-consuming, so I suggest you start immediately. Your first step should be to carefully read <a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1b3a/c4b4187a3dbc9373869e7774b1dc63f748d2.pdf\">the original paper</a>  as well as the <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2016/08/19/353.6301.790.DC1/Jean.SM.pdf\">supplementary materials</a>.\n",

    "For this assignment, we will focus on the country of Rwanda. You will need to download three distinct datasets, including DHS data, satellite data from the Google Maps API, as well as nighttime luminosity data. The DHS data requires registration (which can take several days to be approved), and the Google Maps API is rate-limited, so it will necessarily take you several days to download the requisite data, so make sure to **get started on those steps asap**. The deep learning section may also take several hours to compute (or days, if you have a slow computer), so don't save it until the last minute.\n",

    "Download the images from Google at zoom level 16 (pixel resolution is about 2.5m). Set the image size to be 400 pixels X 400 pixels, so that each image you download will cover 1 square kilometer. In this way, each daytime image you download will correspond to a single pixel from the nighttime imagery from Step 1 above.\n",

    "Note: The Google Map API requires that you \"enable billing on each of your projects.\" Note that \"when you enable billing, you get \\$200 free usage every month for Maps, Routes, or Places. Based on the millions of users using our APIs today, most of them can continue to use Google Maps Platform for free with this credit.\" ([ref](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/user-guide/pricing-changes/)) For this problem set, you will need to download about 50,000 -- this costs about \\$100. So the \\$200 free usage every month should be enough, as long as you are careful :) Remember to set a budget alert to track how your spend is growing toward a particular amount ([ref](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets)).\n",

    " - You will need to tell Google the locations for which you wish to download images. One way to do this is to use a [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) that specifies the borders of Rwanda. We have provided this shapefile (`Sector_Boundary_2012.shp`) as well as a helper function to read in the shapefile.\n",
    " - The function we provide below does not limit the maximum number of images downloaded per day. Note that if you attempt to  download more than the daily limit, Google will return blank images instead of an error.\n",
    " - You can organize the files however you like. However, for later analysis (Steps 6 and beyond), it may help if you organize these daytime images into 64 folders, with one folder indicating the nightlight intensity of the pixel corresponding to the daytime image. In other words, if you download a daytime image for which the corresponding nighttime pixel has value 32, store that daytime image in a folder labeled '32'. This way, all the satellite images within each folder will have the same nightlight intensity. The file name is columnIndex_rowIndex.jpg, in which row index and column index are the index in the nightlight image (See the diagram below)."
